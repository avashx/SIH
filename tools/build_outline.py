"""Build the Sikkim outline the map uses to isolate the study area.

The "Sikkim only" toggle needs a polygon of the area of interest so it can mask
everything outside it. That polygon is not taken from an atlas: it is OUR study
area, the valid footprint of the harmonised LULC raster, which is the same mask
every statistic in the dashboard is computed over. Using anything else would let
the outline and the numbers disagree at the edges.

Writes frontend/data/sikkim.geojson (WGS84). Run once, commit the result:
